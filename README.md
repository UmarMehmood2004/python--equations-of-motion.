# python--motion-calculation.

A Python program to solve physics problems related to motion.

This tool covers a wide range of motion scenarios â€” from simple equations of motion under constant acceleration, to complex motion involving friction and air resistance.

## Features

   -Solve standard equations of motion (kinematics)  
work in progress
  {-Include effects of friction (kinetic and static)  
   -Handle motion with air resistance (linear and quadratic drag)  
   -Simulate projectile motion  
   -Explore particle motion in sealed containers (e.g., ideal gas-like behavior)
   }

## Example Use Cases

   - Calculate final velocity after a certain time
   - Find displacement under constant acceleration
   - Model a falling object with air drag
   - Simulate a particle bouncing inside a box
   - Analyze frictional forces during sliding motio
